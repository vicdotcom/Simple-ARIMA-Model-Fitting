## ARIMA Model for Average Annual Temperature Forecasting
Fitting an ARIMA model to historical average annual temperature data (1900-2023) and forecast future temperatures. 
We determine the best ARIMA model order using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) by performing a systematic grid search over various order combinations ranging from 1 to 5. 
The optimal model with the lowest AIC is then used to forecast temperatures for the next 10 years.
